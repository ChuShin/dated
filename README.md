# DATing Evolutionary Events and Divergence times (DATED)

DATED is a pipeline that provides an efficient single step solution to estimate the level of synonymous substitution (Ks) between paralogous and orthologous sequence pairs. The software utilizes multiprocessing library to speedup Ks calculation for input sequence pairs. The output from the pipeline can be used in the `divergence.R` script to perform mixture model analysis of Ks distribution.
